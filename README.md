#To run the code the user requires tensorflow, numpy ,pandas and scikit as libraries and execute it by specifying the csv file in the format provided by NASDAQ site

After executing it the algorithm gives out a prediction of one day ahead into the future and one can analyse their knowledge on stocks. As stocks are a sensitive topic, any decision taken by you is guided by you alone, do not come at me if u lose money using this code or anything.This tool just analysizes past data and gives out a prediction, nothing more nothing less

#The dataset was taken from NASDAQ's website more info can be found here https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/historical
